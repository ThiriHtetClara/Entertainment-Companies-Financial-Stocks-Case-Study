## Entertainment & Media Stocks - Exploratory Analytics & Dashboard

This repository contains a case study analyzing entertainment/media sector stocks using Python (Jupyter notebooks), a structured CSV dataset, and an interactive Tableau dashboard.

## About the Project

This case study examines price behavior and risk patterns across selected entertainment/media tickers to support data-driven insights for monitoring performance.

The analysis focuses on:

- Return dynamics and rolling volatility
- Moving averages and simple signal construction
- Cross-ticker comparisons and basic correlations
- Visual exploration via an interactive Tableau dashboard

The work is informed by:

- Public market data aggregated into a tidy CSV
- Python-based data cleaning, feature engineering, and charts
- A self-contained Tableau workbook for interactive exploration

## Tools & Methods

- Python: pandas, numpy, matplotlib/seaborn (EDA, feature engineering)
- Jupyter Notebooks: reproducible workflows for data pull/cleaning and RQ-specific analysis
- Tableau: interactive filtering, Top-N, tooltips, and comparative views
- Methods: returns & rolling metrics, correlations, basic trend signals, comparative dashboards

## Contents
- 'data/' — processed CSV
- 'notebooks/' — Jupyter notebooks (data pull + RQ2 + RQ3)
- 'dashboards/tableau/' — Tableau workbook ('.twbx')
